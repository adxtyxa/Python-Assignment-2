# Assignment 2 #

## Task 1 ##
In this task I have written a py code which takes in an integral input and determines whether it is an even number or on odd number by the help of modulus 
operator and if-else conditional statements

## Task 2 ##
In this task I have written a py code which has a variable with an initial value of 0. WIth the help of a for loop from range 1 to 51 (since we want till 50)
I have made the variable loop itself and add each number to it from 1 to 50 in the same sequence and it finally outputs the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50
